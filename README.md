# SnakeGame

A fun classic game built using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript that can make you dive into the memories of bygone times and simple addictive retro games!

It works much like the good old snake game.

-The direction in which the snake moves can be controlled by the four arrow keys

-As the snake keeps consuming the apples, it's length keeps increasing.
